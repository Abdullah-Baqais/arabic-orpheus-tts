# Arabic Orpheus TTS Fine-tuning

Fine-tuning `unsloth/orpheus-3b-0.1-ft` for Arabic speech synthesis using a 2-stage pipeline:

1. Multi-speaker Arabic adaptation
2. Single-speaker specialization

## Highlights

- Formal Arabic / MSA-oriented output
- 2-stage LoRA fine-tuning
- Arabic text normalization
- SNAC-based audio tokenization
- Demo audio samples included

## Important note on data

The training dataset is **not included** in this repository.

I used licensed/restricted data and cannot redistribute:
- raw audio
- metadata
- transcriptions
- processed dataset artifacts derived from the source corpus

This repository only contains the training/inference code, configuration, and demo outputs.

## Repository contents

- `inference.py` — generate speech from text
- `demos/` — sample generated audio

## Training setup

- Base model: `unsloth/orpheus-3b-0.1-ft`
- Stage 1: Arabic multi-speaker training
- Stage 2: single-speaker fine-tuning on a female voice
- Hardware used: L40S
- LoRA fine-tuning with Unsloth
